## Getting Started

Draughts (also known as checkers) is a  strategy board game for two players which involves moving pieces diagonally on an 8Ã—8 (64 cell) checkerboard. Each player has their own colour and begins the game with 12 pieces which can only move and capture in a diagonally forwards direction. If an opponents piece is in the next square, the player can jump over it and capture it, removing the piece from the board. If a player can jump, it must and if after making a jump another jump is possible it must jump again. To win the game you must stop the opponent (computer) from moving when it comes to their turn which can be done by taking all of their pieces or by blocking their pieces so that there is nowhere to move. A piece which reaches the other end of the board is "crowned" a king. Kings are allowed to move and capture diagonally forwards and backwards and so are more powerful and valuable than ordinary pieces. For more information follow this [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draughts).

With Widget Draughts you play against the computer. The human player is white and the computer is black.
