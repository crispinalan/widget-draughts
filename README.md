## Getting Started

Draughts (also known as checkers) is a  strategy board game for two players which involves moving pieces diagonally on an 8Ã—8 (64 cell) checkerboard. Each player has their own colour and begins the game with 12 pieces which can only move and capture in a diagonally forwards direction. If an opponents piece is in the next square, the player can jump over it and capture it, removing the piece from the board. If a player can jump, it must and if after making a jump another jump is possible it must jump again. To win the game you must stop the opponent (computer) from moving when it comes to their turn which can be done by taking all of their pieces or by blocking their pieces so that there is nowhere to move. A piece which reaches the other end of the board is "crowned" a king. Kings are allowed to move and capture diagonally forwards and backwards and so are more powerful and valuable than ordinary pieces. For more information follow this [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draughts).

With Widget Draughts you play against the computer. The human player is white and the computer is black.



## Install Using Deb Package

You can install widgedraughts using deb packages located at [deb-packages](https://github.com/crispinalan/widget-draughts/tree/master/deb-packages/) 

Use the _wwxdraughts_1.0.3_amd64.deb_  package for 64-bit Debian and Debian based distributions (e.g. Linux Mint, Ubuntu and it derivatives). 

Use the _wxdraughts_1.0.3_armhf.deb_  package for the Raspberry Pi.

Right click on the deb package and select "Save Link As" to download.

Further details below:

### Linux Mint Debian Edition (Debbie)

Download the wxdraughts_1.0.3_amd64.deb package into the Downloads directory. Open a terminal and install widgetdraughts using:

```
cd Downloads
sudo dpkg -i wxdraughts_1.0.3_amd64.deb 
```
Entering your sudo (user) password when prompted.

### Debian

Download wxdraughts_1.0.3_amd64.deb package into the Downloads directory.Open a terminal and install widgetdraughts using the commands below (don't forget the "-" with su):

```
user@debian:su -
Password: 
root@debian:~# cd /home/user/Downloads/
root@debian:/home/user/Downloads# dpkg -i wxdraughts_1.0.3_amd64.deb
```

### Raspberry Pi

Download the wxdraughts_1.0.3_armhf.deb package (not the amd64 package) into the Downloads directory. Open a terminal and install widgetdraughts using:

```
cd Downloads
sudo dpkg -i wxdraughts_1.0.3_armhf.deb
```
If widgetdraughts fails to install due to missing dependencies then run

```
sudo apt-get install -f
sudo dpkg -i wxdraughts_1.0.3_armhf.deb
```

The _sudo apt-get install -f_  attempts to fix the problem by installing  the missing dependencies. Then dpkg will install widgetdraughts once the all dependencies are present. 

You have to log out and log back into Raspbian to see the installed widgetdraughts package (menu -> other).

Note: The Raspberry Pi deb package is 32-bit not 64-bit and so should not be used with 64-bit operating systems.

### Build From Source

For other distributions you can build Widget Draughts from source 

```
mkdir build  
cd build  
cmake ..
make
sudo make install 
```
Widget Draughts (wxdraughts) is installed to /usr/local/bin

## Build From Source Prerequisites

To build from source you need to install the following packages (dependencies)

```
sudo apt install build-essential
sudo apt install cmake
sudo apt install libwxgtk3.0-dev
sudo apt install git 
```
